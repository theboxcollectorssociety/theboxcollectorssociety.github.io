Dear Collectors,

After doing some research, I am excited to share my new site with you all on GitHub Pages.
\
I believe this no frills platform is a much better fit for The Box Collectors Society's mission.

The site will serve as an **archive** for the open-access, peer-reviewed articles about gender and neurodivergence
that I share in my newsletters. It will also be a space for me to share my **annual fundraisers** for local organizations.

**In the future**, I plan to host regular, free, guided **makers meetups** with a focus on accessibility.
\
and here is where you will be able to find a calendar, detailed information about
\
meetup accommodations, rules, expectations and a place to rsvp.

As it is only the beginning, I hope you stick around, because I have a lot of fun stuff I've been planning just for you.


xoxo,
Hannah
